  <H2>Key changes for QGIS 2.0</H2>

  <H1>Whats new in Version 2.0.0 'Dufour'?</H1>

  <P>
    This is a new major release. Building on the foundation of
    QGIS 1.x.x releases, QGIS Dufour introduces many new features,
    improvements and bug fixes. Here is a summary of some of the
    key new features.
  </P>

  <UL>
    <li>We have updated out icon theme to use the 'GIS' theme which introduces
      an improved level of consistency and professionalism to the QGIS user
      interface.</li>
    <li>The new symbol layer overview uses a clear, tree-structured layout
      which allows for easy and fast access to all symbol layers.</li>
    <li>QGIS 2.0 now includes Oracle Spatial support.</li>
    <li>With the new data defined properties, it is possible to control symbol
      type, size, color, rotation, and many other properties through feature
      attributes.</li>
    <li>You can now place html elements onto your map.</li>
    <li>Having nicely aligned map items is critical to making nice printed
      maps. Auto snapping lines have been added to allow for easy composer
      object alignment by simply dragging an object close to another.</li>
    <li>Sometimes you need to align objects a curtain distance on the composer.
      With the new manual snapping lines you are able to add manual snap lines
      which allow for better align objects using a common alignment. Simply
      drag from the top or side ruler to add new guide line.</li>
    <li>Ever needed to generate a map series? Of course you have. The composer
      now includes built in map series generation using the atlas feature.
      Coverage layers can be points, lines, polygons, and the current feature
      attribute data is available in labels for on the fly value replacement.
    </li>
    <li>
      A single composer window can now contain more then one page.
    </li>
    <li>
      The composer label item in 1.8 was quite limited and only allowed a single
      token $CURRENT_DATE to be used. In 2.0 full expression support has been
      added too greater power and control of the final labels.
    </li>
    <li>
      The map frame now contains the ability to show the extents of another
      map and will update when moved. Using this with the atlas generation
      feature now core in the composer allows for some slick map generation.
      Overview frame style uses the same styling as a normal map polygo
      n object so your creativity is never restricted.
    </li>
    <li>Layer blending makes it possible to combine layers in new and exciting
      ways. While in older versions, all you could do was to make the layer
      transparent, you can now choose between much more advanced options such as
      "multiply", "darken only", and many more. Blending can be used in the
      normal map view as well as in print composer.
    </li>
    <li>HTML support has been added map composer label item to give you even
      more control over your final maps. HTML labels support full css styles
      sheets, html, and even javascript if you are that way inclined.
    </li>
    <li>The labelling system has been totally overhauled - it now includes many
      new features such as drop shadows, 'highway shields', many more data bound
      options, and various performance enhancements. We are slowly doing away
      with the 'old labels' system, although you will still find that
      functionality available for this release, you should expect that it will
      disappear in a follow up release.
    </li>
    <li>The full power of normal label and rule expressions can now be used for
      label properties. Nearly every property can be defined with an expression
      or field value giving you more control over the label result. Expressions
      can refer to a field (e.g. set the font size to the value of the field
      'font') or can include more complex logic. Examples of bindable
      properties include: Font, Size, Style and Buffer size.
    </li>
    <li>
      With the expression engine being used more and more though out QGIS to
      allow for things like expression based labels and symbol, many more
      functions have been added to the expression builder and are all accessible
      though the expression builder. All functions include comprehensive help
      and usage guides for ease of use.
    </li>
    <li>If the expression engine doesn't have the function that you need. Not to
      worry. New functions can be added via a plugin using a simple Python API.
    </li>
    <li>The Python API has been revamped to allow for a more cleaner, more
      pythonic, programming experience. The QGIS 2.0 API uses SIP V2 which
      removes the messy toString(), toInt() logic that was needed when working
      with values. Types are now converted into native Python types making for a
      much nicer API. Attributes access is now done on the feature itself using
      a simple key lookup, no more index lookup and attribute maps.
      <p><b>Note:</b>Most plugins written for QGIS < 1.x will need to be
        ported to work correctly in QGIS 2.x. Please consult
        <a href="http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20">
         this guide</a> for more details.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The raster data provider system has been completely overhauled. One of
      the best new features stemming from this work is the ability to 'Layer ->
      Save As...' to save any raster layer as a new layer. In the process you
      can clip, resample, and reproject the layer to a new Coordinate Reference
      System. You can also save a raster layer as a rendered image so if you for
      example have single band raster that you have applied a colour palette to,
      you can save the rendered layer out to a georeferenced RGB layer.
    </li>
    <li>There are many, many more new features  in QGIS 2.0 - we invite
      you to explore the software and discover them all!</li>
